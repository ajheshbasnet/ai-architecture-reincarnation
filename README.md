# AI Architecture Reincarnation

A curated collection of re-implementations of foundational artificial intelligence models and architectures from seminal research papers, coded entirely from scratch using Python.

## Overview

This repository contains clean, well-documented implementations of influential AI architectures, built from first principles in Python to understand their core mechanisms and design patterns. Each implementation is coded from the ground up without relying on high-level abstractions, staying faithful to the original papers while providing modern, readable code.

## Implementations

### Computer Vision
- **ClassicCNNs** - Foundational convolutional neural network architectures
- **ViT-CIFAR10-Classifier** - Vision Transformer implementation for CIFAR-10 classification
- **Vision-Transformer-from-first-principle/ViT** - Vision Transformer built from fundamental principles

### Natural Language Processing
- **LLaMA-2-from-Scratch** - Large Language Model implementation based on LLaMA 2 architecture
- **LSTM-NextWord** - LSTM-based next word prediction model
- **gpt2-reincarnate-reddit** - GPT-2 implementation trained on Reddit data

### Advanced Architectures
- **Mixture-of-Experts-Logic** - MoE architecture implementation
- **tldr-reddit-summarizer** - Text summarization model for Reddit posts
- **openai-gpt-oss** - Open-source GPT implementation

## Project Structure

Each subdirectory contains:
- Implementation code
- Model architecture details
- Training scripts (where applicable)
- Documentation specific to that architecture

## Getting Started

Each implementation is self-contained within its respective directory. Navigate to the specific architecture folder for detailed setup instructions and usage examples.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A learning resource for understanding AI architectures at a deep level
- Reference implementations for research and education
- A foundation for experimenting with architectural modifications

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please ensure any new implementations maintain the repository's standards of code clarity and documentation.

## License

Please refer to individual subdirectories for specific licensing information related to each implementation.

## Acknowledgments

These implementations are based on original research papers and architectures developed by various research teams and institutions. Proper attribution is maintained within each subdirectory.
